A quick demo of the modifications I've made to the C++ scanner. This is
just a simple key/value scanner. The format is key = value. Comments
can be added on separate lines or at the end of lines with #. Values
can be quoted. Hashmarks appearing within quoted strings will be part
of the string and not counted as a comment.

I generated frkv.yy.h with "flex --c++ --yyclass=frkv -o frkv.yy.cc frkv.l"
and then added the boost signals and key boolean value to to the class.
Note that rerunning flex once this file exists will NOT overwrite your
customized header file. It will regenerate the .yy.cc file, though.

Once I got done modifying the header, compile with g++ -c frkv.yy.c,
g++ -c main.c, g++ -o frkv main.o frkv.yy.o. Test with cat test.txt | ./frkv
