Notes for building flex for cross-toolchain
-------------------------------------------

Flex generates scanner code for C and C++, and has no architecture-
specific parts. Therefore flex's build system does not support
'--target' option that people would use to configuring a cross-
compiler. However, flex has one library, libfl, that is intended to be
linked with flex-generated code and installed to the target system.

If you are building flex intended to be used with a cross-toolchain,
for the main flex program you should disable libfl while configuring:

```bash
./configure --disable-libfl && make && make install
```

This way you won't get a useless library built for your host system.

You may run configure again and build libfl for the target.
For example:

```bash
./configure --build=$(build-aux/config.guess) --host=${target} &&
cd src &&
make src/libfl.la &&
make DESTDIR=${sysroot} install-libLTLIBRARIES
```

(For now the commands of building and installing libfl alone is tricky.
This might be fixed in the future.)
