Subject: Re: Flex 2.5.2 performance questions
In-reply-to: Your message of Wed, 18 Sep 96 11:12:17 EDT.

From: Vern Paxson &lt;vern&gt;

[Note, the most recent flex release is 2.5.4, which you can get from
ftp.ee.lbl.gov.  It has bug fixes over 2.5.2 and 2.5.3.]

&gt; 1. Using the pattern
&gt;    ([Ff](oot)?)?[Nn](ote)?(\.)?
&gt;    instead of
&gt;    (((F|f)oot(N|n)ote)|((N|n)ote)|((N|n)\.)|((F|f)(N|n)(\.)))
&gt;    (in a very complicated flex program) caused the program to slow from
&gt;    300K+/min to 100K/min (no other changes were done).

These two are not equivalent.  For example, the first can match &quot;footnote.&quot;
but the second can only match &quot;footnote&quot;.  This is almost certainly the
cause in the discrepancy - the slower scanner run is matching more tokens,
and/or having to do more backing up.

&gt; 2. Which of these two are better: [Ff]oot or (F|f)oot ?

From a performance point of view, they're equivalent (modulo presumably
minor effects such as memory cache hit rates; and the presence of trailing
context, see below).  From a space point of view, the first is slightly
preferable.

&gt; 3. I have a pattern that look like this:
&gt;    pats {p1}|{p2}|{p3}|...|{p50}     (50 patterns ORd)
&gt;
&gt;    running yet another complicated program that includes the following rule:
&gt;    &lt;snext&gt;{and}/{no4}{bb}{pats}
&gt;
&gt;    gets me to &quot;too complicated - over 32,000 states&quot;...

I can't tell from this example whether the trailing context is variable-length
or fixed-length (it could be the latter if {and} is fixed-length).  If it's
variable length, which flex -p will tell you, then this reflects a basic
performance problem, and if you can eliminate it by restructuring your
scanner, you will see significant improvement.

&gt;    so I divided {pats} to {pats1}, {pats2},..., {pats5} each consists of about
&gt;    10 patterns and changed the rule to be 5 rules.
&gt;    This did compile, but what is the rule of thumb here ?

The rule is to avoid trailing context other than fixed-length, in which for
a/b, either the 'a' pattern or the 'b' pattern have a fixed length.  Use
of the '|' operator automatically makes the pattern variable length, so in
this case '[Ff]oot' is preferred to '(F|f)oot'.

&gt; 4. I changed a rule that looked like this:
&gt;    &lt;snext8&gt;{and}{bb}/{ROMAN}[^A-Za-z] { BEGIN...
&gt;
&gt;    to the next 2 rules:
&gt;    &lt;snext8&gt;{and}{bb}/{ROMAN}[A-Za-z] { ECHO;}
&gt;    &lt;snext8&gt;{and}{bb}/{ROMAN}         { BEGIN...
&gt;
&gt;    Again, I understand the using [^...] will cause a great performance loss

Actually, it doesn't cause any sort of performance loss.  It's a surprising
fact about regular expressions that they always match in linear time
regardless of how complex they are.

&gt;    but are there any specific rules about it ?

See the &quot;Performance Considerations&quot; section of the man page, and also
the example in MISC/fastwc/.
