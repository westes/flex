From: Vern Paxson &lt;vern&gt;

&gt; Enclosed is a lex file that &quot;real&quot; lex will process, but I cannot get
&gt; flex to process it.  Could you try it and maybe point me in the right direction?

Your problem is that some of the definitions in the scanner use the '/'
trailing context operator, and have it enclosed in ()'s.  Flex does not
allow this operator to be enclosed in ()'s because doing so allows undefined
regular expressions such as &quot;(a/b)+&quot;.  So the solution is to remove the
parentheses.  Note that you must also be building the scanner with the -l
option for AT&amp;T lex compatibility.  Without this option, flex automatically
encloses the definitions in parentheses.
