Subject: Re: More than 32K states change hangs
In-reply-to: Your message of Tue, 04 Aug 1998 16:55:39 PDT.

From: Vern Paxson &lt;vern&gt;

&gt; Vern Paxson,
&gt;
&gt; I followed your advice, posted on Usenet bu you, and emailed to me
&gt; personally by you, on how to overcome the 32K states limit. I'm running
&gt; on Linux machines.
&gt; I took the full source of version 2.5.4 and did the following changes in
&gt; flexdef.h:
&gt; #define JAMSTATE -327660
&gt; #define MAXIMUM_MNS 319990
&gt; #define BAD_SUBSCRIPT -327670
&gt; #define MAX_SHORT 327000
&gt;
&gt; and compiled.
&gt; All looked fine, including check and bigcheck, so I installed.

Hmmm, you shouldn't increase MAX_SHORT, though looking through my email
archives I see that I did indeed recommend doing so.  Try setting it back
to 32700; that should suffice that you no longer need -Ca.  If it still
hangs, then the interesting question is - where?

&gt; Compiling the same hanged program with a out-of-the-box (RedHat 4.2
&gt; distribution of Linux)
&gt; flex 2.5.4 binary works.

Since Linux comes with source code, you should diff it against what
you have to see what problems they missed.

&gt; Should I always compile with the -Ca option now ? even short and simple
&gt; filters ?

No, definitely not.  It's meant to be for those situations where you
absolutely must squeeze every last cycle out of your scanner.

		Vern
