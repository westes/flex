Dear Dr. Paxon,

I have been using flex for years.
It works very well on many projects.
Most case, I used it to generate a scanner on C language.
However, one project I needed to generate  a scanner
on C++ lanuage. Thanks to your enhancement, flex did
the job.

Currently, I'm working on enhancing my previous project.
I need to deal with multiple input streams (recursive
inclusion) in this scanner (C++).
I did similar thing for another scanner (C) as you
explained in your documentation.

The generated scanner (C++) has necessary methods:
- switch_to_buffer(struct yy_buffer_state *b)
- yy_create_buffer(istream *is, int sz)
- yy_delete_buffer(struct yy_buffer_state *b)

However, I couldn't figure out how to access current
buffer (yy_current_buffer).

yy_current_buffer is a protected member of yyFlexLexer.
I can't access it directly.
Then, I thought yy_create_buffer() with is = 0 might
return current stream buffer. But it seems not as far
as I checked the source. (flex 2.5.4)

I went through the Web in addition to Flex documentation.
However, it hasn't been successful, so far.

It is not my intention to bother you, but, can you
comment about how to obtain the current stream buffer?

Your response would be highly appreciated.

Best regards,
Aki Niimura
