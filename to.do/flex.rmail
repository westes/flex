Okay, you can get a copy of the master sources from

        ftp://ftp.ee.lbl.gov/.vp-flex-sources.tar.gz

The TODO/ subdirectory has the general wish list plus a number of contributed
patches.  The faqs/ subdirectory has a bunch of email messages (in MH
folder format, i.e., one message per file, files numbered sequentially)
for commonly asked questions - worth taking a look through to see what
sorts of things people frequently ask about.

Next messages are various stuff I sent to Dick King.

Thanks for giving it a try - naturally, by all means let me know when you
have questions ...

Okay, I've put the master sources in

The TODO/ subdirectory has a the general wish list plus a number of

I very much appreciate your taking over maintaining/developing flex, and
apologize for how long it's taken me to bundle stuff up to give to you (all
too symptomatic of why I'm no longer able to work on flex :-( ).  By all
means, let me know when you have questions ...

John Bossom contributed patches a while ago for adding reentrant scanners.
I never managed to try them out or integrate them (note that I'm no longer

King, whom I've cc'd), but I've made them available from:

I've only directly support flex for Unix, and have always distributed it
in source-code form only.  So I don't know where you get a copy, though
I bet with some web surfing you can find one.

Also, please note, Dick King (cc'd) has taken over flex development

I have a couple of how-to-be-a-gnu-product-maintainer questions.

First, how do i get to the wish list?  I assume people mail the stuff and it
accumulates somewhere.

Second, if i decide i have a fix for a group of problems what do i do to get it
distributed?

There's a honed-down copy in the distribution I put together.  I also have
several hundred email messages, which will be rather tedious to wade through,
but I can put together for you if you wish (this is non-trivial, though,
since there's some personal mail intermixed in it which I'll have to locate
and remove).

> Second, if i decide i have a fix for a group of problems what do i do to get it

Put together a new release distribution (either a minor version change or
a major one, depennding on the scope of the changes).  Make sure it works
with "make bigcheck", and make sure you can copy the distribution to a
virgin machine, unpack it & successfully build it (including "make bigcheck").

Next, make it available somewhere for anonymous ftp and/or Web access.
(If this is a problem, I can still host the distribution at ftp.ee.lbl.gov.)

Finally, send mail like the appended example.  For your first message,
you should explain that you've taken over development of flex from me.
It would probably be good to cc me, in case a thread develops from the
note that it would be helpful to have me contribute to.  No need to cc
me on later notes (though I don't mind, either).

I used to send the note to compilers@iecc.com (the USENET comp.compilers
group) and info-gnu@prep.ai.mit.edu.  I don't know if the former is still
the correct address - you could find out from the USENET group's archives,
presumably.  The latter has likely changed to info-gnu@gnu.org.

Subject:  flex release 2.5.1 now available
To:  compilers@iecc.com, info-gnu@prep.ai.mit.edu

Release 2.5.1 of flex, a POSIX-compliant "lex" scanner generator, is now
available for anonymous ftp to ftp.ee.lbl.gov.  Retrieve flex-2.5.1.tar.Z
or flex-2.5.1.tar.gz.  flex-2.5.1.tar.gz should be showing up shortly at
the usual GNU mirror sites.

The main changes between 2.5 and 2.4 are:

	- A new concept of "start condition" scope lets you group together
	  rules sharing the same start conditions into a syntactic unit.
	- Flex now includes a general mechanism for specifying scanner options.
	- Routines have been added for scanning strings instead of files.
	- Routines have been added for manipulating stacks of start conditions.
	- Fledgling support for POSIX character class expressions.
	- Enhanced portability to MS-DOS, VMS, NT, Macintosh, Amiga.
	- A number of bugs have been fixed.
	- input() no longer trashes yytext.
	- Interactive scanners now run significantly faster.
	- C++ scanner objects now work with the -P option.
	- The promised rewrite of the C++ FlexLexer class has not been done,
	  but is still planned.

See the "NEWS" file for more details.

Well, clearly if a comment is larger than the available memory, then flex
can't realloc to accommodate it.  But presumably that's not what's going on
or you wouldn't have bothered writing; so I don't know what the problem
might be.

Flex is now developed & maintained by Dick King, king@reasoning.com, whom

Dick King (king@reasoning.com) has recently taken over flex maintenance and
development (I've cc'd him).  Since there will be a fair amount of getting
up to speed for him, I think building your own version for now is the
best course.

Well, that's how you have to do it, I'm afraid.  I can't see any practical
way to add this as a feature to flex at a later stage in the input analysis,
since the semantics really are "pretend this slash and this newline don't
exist (mod line numbers)".  What you can probably do for line numbers is
the following: create a data structure that maps byte offsets in the current
input stream to line numbers.  YY_INPUT would fill this in as it returns
new (possibly munged) lines, and your actions would consult it in order to
generate correct location information for error messages.  (To deal with
multiple input buffers, you maintain one data structure per buffer.)

I don't offhand see an easy way to fix this, other than scanning the source

Dick will have to toss it onto the to-do list.

OK.

To: Dick King
Bison seems to under revision right now (I'm working hard with the Bison
development team just these days on pinpointing some bugs). -- Perhaps Flex
& Bison development should somehow be synchronized.

I have labelled Flex as BSD. Is that correct?

I imagine it is.  This problem has come up a bunch of times, and,

I'm getting my flex support operations organized, finally.

I've established a new eddress, flex@2xtreme.net .

I'll start looking at the small bug fixes flex has been asked for in a week or
so.  Then i will get to meaty changes.

One meaty change i've been asked for which i would like to do [i did it for my
current company's lexer product so i think i understand the issues] is a
character level prefilter infrastructure, that would allow you to integrate a
cpp-style preprocessor [rather than making it a separate pass as is the norm]
or to write a flex lexer for a language like FORTRAN or COBOL or that language
i've heard about whose name escapes me where indentation is syntactically
significant.

I'm unable to compile the scan.l LEX specification using the bootstrap
scanner, initscan.c. I have tried it on the latest flex source from GNU,
and the tarball from your page at ee.lbl.gov.

If I drop the "%option reentrant" from scan.l, then it all compiles. I
doubt it works right then. What else do I need here, a new initscan.c?

Thanks for the help.

I don't have any firsthand experience with those patches, unfortunately,
so all I can offer is to try building without the %option reentrant;
then run flex on scan.l to build a new scan.c; recompile using that;
run "make check" to make sure it's working okay; then try putting the
%option reentrant back in.  Because I believe the modified scan.l doesn't
actually need %option reentrant, it's just there to exercise the scanning
during "make check".

I'm actually no longer the maintainer.  Dick King has taken over.  He's set
up the address flex@2xtreme.net for flex correspondence.  I've cc'd him.

What you are doing looks like a parse, and you can only parse LR(0)
languages with DFAs (if I recall correctly), i.e., those without
lookahead.  The above example requires lookahead to differentiate
matching foo from bar.  So I think you're out of luck here, if
I understand the example correctly.

Vern is mostly correct.  Small extensions can give you a single token
[character, here] lookahead but that is not enough to deliver the
functionality you want.  Consider

foo: a    { foo_fn(); }
bar: ab   { bar_fn(); }

mumble:    foo bcde.....yZ   { any }
         | bar  cde.....yW   { any }

My experimenting with C++ though suggests that Bison and Flex needs some
synchronizing if one should take full advantage of that language:

- -- One thing that come to my mind is that instead of letting the Bison
output .cc file include the Flex .cc file, they communicate the information
via header files.

- -- When experimenting C++ manipulator style I mentioned before
    Parser parser;
    parser_value val;
    ifstream ifs("...", ios_base::in | ios_base::binary);
    ofstream ofs("...");
    if (ifs) try { for (;;) {
        ifs >> parser >> val;
        cout << val << endl;
    }
I experience problems with how Flex resets its state, and how streams and
such are initialized.

For example, if I try to gobble up UNIX, MacOS & DOS line separators in Flex by
    \n|\r|\r\n		 { return '\n'; }
then, when Flex sees a \r it must first look ahead to verify the next
character isn't a \n. However, if a successful value "val" is produced,
then the next time  one ends up at the line ifs >> parser >> val, Flex is
reset, and as a consequence, the extra character needed to the \n check is
gobbled up.

One can get around this by not allowing this ifs >> parser >> val
construct, then the advantage of freer, and therefore easier user syntaxes
are lost.

- -- I think that there might be some other issues, such as how to properly
localize all data that Bison and Flex uses, and how they should communicate
that. These are more questions of hand-shaking than bundling them together
as a single program.

As for the comparisons of Bison and Flex versus other types of
compiler-compilers, I think the main disadvantage with them (the former) is
that they are extremely difficult to debug. It's rather hopeless trying to
debug the C/C++ files they produce as output. If one could hook up an
debugger though, so that one could step throw the .l/.y source files, just
as in the case of visual debugging of a C/C++ file, then this would change,
and it would not make any difference of what method is used, as long as it
is efficient and does the job.

Yep, this is a known problem.  The difficulty is that when lex was
originally designed, it allowed you to switch start states using
"BEGIN msg" rather than "BEGIN(msg)".  This means that either you
do a major analysis of the source to only patch up true BEGIN's
(rather than, say, one that occurs inside a string literal); or you
use a gross hack in defining BEGIN, like flex does:

	#define BEGIN yy_start = 1 + 2 *

With this sort of definition, there's no way to modify the namespace
consumed by start states.  If instead you could require the ()'s, then
you could use

	#define BEGIN(state) yy_start = 1 + 2 * (YY_STATE_ ## state)

and all would be happy ...

Hi Vern,

I'm using your flex package 2.5.4 on a Macintosh with Apple's Macintosh
Programmers Workshop 3.5 (MPW). There is a description comming along
with your package for the THINK C version 6.0 from Scott Hofmann
(23-JUL-94) which is not helpfull for using the package with MPW. I
enclosed a brief instruction for using the flex package with MPW which
might be more helpfull since Think C is no longer officially available
(as far as I know).

greetings,
Kai




Notes on the MPW 3.5 version of Flex 2.5.4
Kai Hennig 25-Mar-2001
Internet: khennig@pobox.com

To compile and run Flex 2.5.4 as an MPW Tool no changes to any file have
to be done. Instead add a file called 'config.h' to the files listed in
the command lines given below with the content listed below the
commands. To compile and link all necessary files execute the following
commands in the MPW shell:

MrC -noMapCR -alloca -ansi strict main.c
MrC -noMapCR -alloca -ansi strict ccl.c
MrC -noMapCR -alloca -ansi strict dfa.c

Both of these are not well defined at the moment.  Will Estes (cc'd) has
volunteered to give taking over flex maintenance/development a try, and
we're right now in a preliminary period during which he's gauging whether
he'll indeed have the cycles for doing so.

Argh, yes, you're right.  This is (mis)feature interaction between
%option yylineno and trailing context.

I've cc'd Will Estes, who is trying out taking over flex maintenance /
development.  Will, I think the place to fix this is in finish_rule() in
nfa.c, making it generate extra code to loop through the characters being
put back and decrement yylineno accordingly.

Hi,

(Sorry it took a while, my DSL went down again.)

Here is a link to the diff, because my browser (Opera) doesn't do file-uploads
properly.

http://astro.temple.edu/~john43/flex_r.diff.gz

I did not include a diff of skel.c, because it is built from flex.skl. I did a GNU
diff, instead of CVS diff, because I had already modified flex before importing it
into CVS... which means `cvs diff' won't work without some massaging. I'm no CVS
expert, let me know if you have a solution.

This all works, but is not finished. I want to test it with as many scanners as I
can dig up. At some point, I'll submit a test directory and a "README.reenrant" as
well as a modification of the texinfo docs.

Briefly, the changes are these:

1. Added option "reentrant" (-R).
2. Added preprocessor directive: YY_REENTRANT. (and a few more related to this).
3. Added internal "struct yy_globals_t"; user-visible as "void*".
4. All global variables are conditionally eliminated and placed in the struct.
5. Nearly all functions conditionally take an additional argument.
6. yylex() is now yylex_r(void*)
7. All access to globals must be wrapped in YY_G() macro.
8. User may attach arbitrary data (void*) to the scanner, to maintain state.
9. New functions for using scanner:  yy_init_r, yy_free_r;
10. Accessor functions to extract values from struct or globals.
11. Frequently accessed variables (yytext, yyleng, etc..) have macro shortcuts,
(yytext_r, yyleng_r, etc.) which hide the internals from users building reentrant
scanners.

Just do `./mkskel.sh <flex.skl >skel.c` to rebuild it.

Will do.

Have you thought about sourceforge?

Yes, finished. But the changes were so widespread and there are so many options and
directives that I'm sure something will break very soon. That's why a
regression-test directory would be nice.

OK.

It is not. In fact, yacc/bison parsers won't call yylex_r()... something I'll work
on later.

Great. Please include my email address.

Also, the community should really decide on the new API. I am wide open to
suggestions. Currently, the new API allows a lexer to be backwards compatible, so
that a working reentrant scanner should be able to be recompiled as a non-reentrant
scanner, and everything will work just dandy on the inside. However, the syntax is
not so pretty for the user. On the other hand, a reentrant scanner that is not
meant to be backwards compatible has a cleaner API (fewer oddball macros).

An example to illustrate:

%option reentrant
%s FOOBAR

%%

  /* The line in each pair below do the same thing.
     But second of each pair is backwards-compatible. */

"call-func"  { yy_push_state ( FOOBAR , yy_globals ); }
"call-func"  { yy_push_state ( FOOBAR  YYCALL_LAST_ARG ); }

"user-data"  { printf( (char*) yyusr_r );}
"user-data"  { printf( (char*) yy_get_usr(YYCALL_ONLY_ARG));}

"yyleng"     { printf( "%s %d" , yy_text_r, yyleng_r ); }
"yyleng"     { printf( "%s %d" , YY_G(yy_text), YY_G(yyleng)); }

%%
main()
{
    char* stuff = "user specific data.";
    void * mylexer;
   
    yy_init_r ( & mylexer );       /* Create the scanner. */
    yy_set_usr( stuff, mylexer );  /* set user-defined stuff. */

    while( 1 )
        yylex_r ( lexer );

    yy_free_r ( lexer );
}

I'm sure you haven't had time to look at it yet, but there are two other points I
wanted to mention:

1. Once the reentrant scanner is working, there is no need for the non-reentrant
scanner. The non-reentrant API can be built as a wrapper around the reentrant
scanner. Much, much less code maintenance. I will happily do the conversion.

2. The reentrancy can be verified, in part, by running `nm -A -l' on a compiled
scanner. `nm` is part of binutils and shows, among other things, the global
variables. In the reentrant scanner, there should be none.

-John Millaway

PS - What is the mailing list? I guess I should subscribe! The gnu site says that
there is currently no list for flex:

Will, Thank you for reply!

I spent the whole day yesterday writing awk script to
convert normal flex output to thread-safe form.

If you do not have time or will need help with this
work on flex -- I can do anything from research, programming
to testing. Just let me know -- I digged into it to some
extent already and will have some time in the coming weeks.

Kind Regards,
Yuri.

That was the whole message.  The basic problem that people run into
is they want reentrant scanners, so no statics or global variables.
The general strategy for this is to have a new yylex() interface in
which the caller passes in a struct that has all of the otherwise-global
variables.  This is a bit tricky to do cleanly because you can't switch
to that as *the* interface, of course, because it would break the
existing API; which means you have to be able to generate two forms of
the skeleton file, one for the existing API with the statics/globals,
and one without them and the struct definition instead.

There's probably some more discussion on this in the mail tarball I sent
you - search for "reentrant".

Hello,

   I am trying to port both Flex and Bison to a Real Time OS. I don't have
the device options like the file which the Flex expects as input. In the
place of the file i have a character pointer. How should I proceed with
the parsing ? 

  Is there any standard procedure for this porting ? If somebody has
already done such a work can i have some hints please.

Thank You.

Hello,

There is a "bug" in the current version of flex (2.5.4) in which the %option
[no]main unconditionally sets the %option [no]yywrap. I use the term "bug"
hesitantly, because this behavior appears to be intentional. However, I can't think
of any use for it other than to cause unexpected link errors when yywrap() is not
found.

Example:

  %option noyywrap  /* Disable option yywrap. */
  %option nomain    /* Option yywrap is now enabled! */

One workaround is to always specify %option yywrap AFTER %option main. In general,
if the user explicitly sets an option, then flex should either honor that setting,
or report a conflict.

The bug is in "scan.l" at line 247, and is undocumented.

244:	lex-compat	lex_compat = option_sense;
245:	main		{
246:			action_define( "YY_MAIN", option_sense );
247:			do_yywrap = ! option_sense;
248:			}
249:	meta-ecs	usemecs = option_sense;

You should call yy_scan_string before calling yylex. Here are two examples:

1. In general:

  YY_BUFFER_STATE buf_state = yy_scan_string( str );
  while( yylex() != 0 )
      ;
  yy_delete_buffer(buf_state);


2. Your particular scanner:

%{
#define YY_USER_INIT  buf_state = yy_scan_string( name );
%}
%%
    static YY_BUFFER_STATE buf_state;

<<EOF>>   { yy_buffer_delete( buf_state ); yyterminate(); }
%%

I think I did that (which is documented in the manual, by the way) so that
"%option main" would be a quick way to specify you want a bare-bones
program for which you don't have to define any additional routines.
I'd be disinclined to change it (though it's Will's call) because it's
so easy to work around - just don't use "%option main", which is only
saving you a few lines of code anyway.

Additionally, flex.1 says the following:

       main   directs  flex  to  provide a default main() program
              for the scanner, which simply calls yylex().   This
              option implies noyywrap (see below).

My sense is that Vern is correct: The right thing to do is to not use
%option main if you want yywrap() to be under your control.

Thanks,

Hi,

First off I was wondering if there is an official web site for Flex?

Second, I would like to be able to have Flex use certain characters in a
regular expression to match the expression but suppress copying the
characters to yytext.  A simple example would be if I was trying to match
text surrounded by quotes, but I don't want to use the quotes. i.e.

\"[^\n]\"		{ yylval = strdup(yytext); //This gives me the text and quotes. }

or

\"[^\n]\"		{ yylval = strdup(yytext+1); yylval[strlen(yylval)-1] = '\0';
//Now I've removed the quotes. }

But since I'm lazy ;)  I would like to be able to tell Flex not to copy the
quotes.  What I would like is an operator that would tell flex to match an
expression but to not copy it to yytext.  Off the top of my head maybe the #
symbol could work for such an operator, so I could then do:

\"#[^\n]\"#	{ yylval = strdup(yytext); //This would give me the text without
the quotes. }

Does anyone know if such a feature or something similar exists?  If this
doesn't exists would it be practical?

Thanks,

You can do that with a start condition and trailing context rules. I.e.
roughly like this:

<INITIAL>\"	BEGIN(IN_STRING)

<IN_STRING>[^\n]*/\"	{ 
			/* yytext is the interior of the string, now */
			BEGIN(INITIAL)
			}

I understand, and it makes sense. Just be aware that the inverse of this rule is
also true --  %option nomain implies yywrap -- which makes much less sense.

Of course, I only complain because it had me on one heck of a bug hunt. I had
specified %option noyywrap and %option nomain, yet the linker complained that it
couldn't find yywrap. I thought I had broken something! :)

Will,
Progress update: This week is finals week. I'll send the tarballs soon.

I made another, very minor, adjustment a few days ago:  The integer yylineno will
always be present in reentrant scanners, but only modified by flex if %option
yylineno is enabled.  Many scanners I have seen and built will disable %option
yylineno, then declare an integer "lineno" to keep a line count anyway, (because
the man page warns about the performance penalty of %option yylineno.) This way,
reentrant flex provides support for users who wish to maintain their own linecount.

  /* just like 'wc -l' */
  %option reentrant noyylineno main
  %%
           yylineno_r = 1;

  \n       yylineno_r++;
  .        { }
  <<EOF>>  printf( "%7d", yylineno_r);

Another important note: As far as I know, none of my modifications should have any
effect on NON-reentrant scanners. In fact, I believe compiled scanners generated
with the previous version should be binary equivalent to non-reentrant scanners
generated with the new version. I have not verified this, but if they are not, then
I may have made an oversight.

Hi,

Most everything can be overridden by the user. However the size of the input
buffer, YY_BUF_SIZE, is fixed. Is there a reason why YY_BUF_SIZE can't be
overridden?

Let's say I knew that all my tokens will match under 80 characters plus newlines,
plus nulls, plus flex-flags... I might decide to set YY_BUF_SIZE to 100.

-John

My concerns are this:
1. The build relies on bison or yacc. Is this intentional? Why not include the
parse.c and parse.h in the dist?

2. The TESTS/ "make check" stops at the first error. I'm thinking it may not be
what we want. The change is simple: Omit the "|| exit -1" part from the commands in
TESTS/Makefile.in.

3. Since I'm not the autoconf guru, I couldn't find a cleaner way to do all the
tests. So I just used a /bin/sh loop in the TESTS/Makefile.in.

No, it is by no means complete. Yes, missing feature tests are bugs of a sort. The
test suite was designed to cope with all the possible build configurations of a
generated scanner, while developing flex itself. I didn't want to modify or add one
feature, but break another. The breakage would easily go unnoticed.

>From the top of my head, I didn't test %array, REJECT, and yy_set_bol, because I
plain forgot about them. I didn't test the C++ option because it is broken AFAIK.
All of the tests came in handy at one point or another during the past month,
though.

I don't remember offhand why I didn't make it redefinable, but note that
you can effect smaller buffer sizes using yy_create_buffer().

Hi
     We have been using flex generated scanners for a project. In our
application, we need to ensure that the application does not exit on system
errors including memory allocation failures. For errors that might occur
while the scanner allocates memory, we thought we would re-define
YY_FATAL_ERROR to something like
#define YY_FATAL_ERROR(x) return (error_indication=x, 0)
where error_indication is a global that I would check after the lexer
returns. This however is not feasible since YY_FATAL_ERROR is used in
functions called within yylex. Some of these do not return values. Also
yylex doesn't check if the called function encountered errors.
Is there any plan to enhance flex to return cleanly from yylex instead of
using exit() ? If not, any references on how to go about modifying the
skeleton scanner for this feature ?

-Binu

You might get away with something like this (without having to modify the skeleton
code):   yyerror sets a flag, then resets the scanner, pointing the input to
/dev/null.
The parser will have to check the error flag, of course.

I posted part of this question to comp.compilers, and John Millaway pointed
me here.  Thanks John.  I've read the archives but did not see this topic
discussed.

In FLEX, the current buffer is flushed immediately when EOF is encountered,
even if it contains a token pushed by yymore().  That means that something
like:
    <start_cond><<EOF>>{If (yyleng > 0) return(A_TOKEN) .... }
fails, because yyleng may be non-zero but yytext is null.  The token is
copied to the start of the buffer but is then overwritten by the buffer
flush (via yyrestart).

I modified the skeleton to check this out.  If the call to yyrestart is
bypassed (OK in my case), the problem partly goes away.  Is this a bug or an
unintended byproduct?

The core issue relates to <<EOF>> and what actions after <<EOF>> are
allowed.  <<EOF>> is logically a state rather than a token, and the null
return (after yywrap) makes perfect sense to me.  The comment in the code
about a repeated call returning null again also makes sense, but it seems to
me that allowing the return of a residual token (pushed by yymore) would be
appropriate.  I realize the difficulty in trying to allow <<EOF>> as right
context in a pattern, and I had hoped to accomplish the same thing via the
<<EOF>> rules.

Currently at <<EOF>> yyleng is set to 1 plus the yymore length, and I would
propose that it should be set to the yymore length only (usually 0).  The
scan has to rely on the trailing null in the buffer to identify the <<EOF>>
state, but should it be treated as an actual token?  (In the case above I
needed to use --yyleng.)

I understand the need to reset the buffer in case the user has changed yyin.

The man page specifies that repeated calls after EOF are undefined.  Would
defining them such that zero additional characters are matched and that null
is returned be an improvement?  Should the calculation of yyleng at <<EOF>>
be changed?  Should there be a change regarding the buffer flush to allow
the residual token to be returned?

My case involves recognizing identifiers which may contain extralingual
characters defined at runtime.

Thank you.

Bill Fenlason

Hello Will,

Are you currently the one responsible for FLEX development and maint?  I saw
you pointed to in the FLEX help archives.

Since no one has commented on my recent message regarding yymore() and
<<EOF>>, I though I would send you a note directly.

Are you interested in a patch and documentation changes?  I'll be happy to
develop them and send them to you.  It will be some work for me since I
would want to be sure that everything is bulletproof.  But I don't want to
spend the time on it if there is no agreement that the change is both needed
and wanted.

The reason I'm implementing this is that the parser interface routine I'm
developing builds a token chain that includes tokens for missing ending
delimiters (comment ends, quotes, parens, etc, as well as include file end
identifiers.  It is convenient to keep generating zero length tokens at
<<EOF>> to handle this, with the final YY_NULL being delayed until nothing
is outstanding or pushed with yymore().  Leaving repeated calls after EOF as
undefined and undocumented seems to me to be a loose end that might well be
clarified.  I think that my approach makes sense in general, and had hoped
that others more experienced with FLEX would point out some pros and cons.

I have some other topics to ask about along with some suggestions, and it
will be helpful to know if you are interested in this or other changes and
additions to FLEX.

I'll be using a modified skeleton in any event so I'm not dependent (or
asking for) any "official" changes.  But FLEX is a wonderful tool, and I
wouldn't mind contributing something to it if I am able to.

Thanks.

Bill Fenlason

ps I assume that Vern is a very busy guy so I have not written to him.  But
feel free to forward this to him if you think it appropriate.

Will,

Thanks for responding, and for pointing out that I could keep track of the
paired delimiter state in the calling program - certainly a reasonable
question.

I decided against that approach primarily because I didn't want to
complicate the calling program unnecessarily.  I found that treating this as
a scanning function allowed the overall coding to be smaller and more
reasonable.  For example, I handle nested comments, and the scanner needs to
use separate start conditions.  The nesting level needs to be maintained for
that any way, so using additional calls after eof makes it really simple - I
just return the zero length "missing delimeter" tokens and decrease the
nesting level.  When it reaches zero I go back to the base state and YY_NULL
is returned.  All in all, trying to keep track in both places is a
duplication.

But that does not explain the yymore() issue.  The language I'm scanning
(PL/I) allows identifier name characters to be specified at runtime.  The
feature is to support foreign language keyboards etc.  So the problem is how
to scan them?  I don't want to force the calling program to paste parts of a
word together, and I have to test any non conventional character (i.e.
128-255) to determine if it is a name character or not.  My solution is to
yymore() each word, and either append a valid extralingual character or
return the word.  Works great, except at EOF.  I don't want to depend on a
trailing NL character, although it would be present almost all of the time.
(After 35 years of programming, I've learned the value of making things
bulletproof  8:-).

Finally, the actions at eof I'm proposing just "feel right".  I hope after
some reflection you come to the same conclusion.  I'll be glad to go into
lots more detail in case you have any fine points to consider.

The next few issues I have relate to providing assistance for unlimied
include file nesting, and how to assist with token location information
(yylineno and offset) without having the performance robbing rescan for NL.
Also I'd like to kick around some ideas related to gen.c and skeletons.

Would you rather that I discuss these things with you directly, or should I
use the list?  I don't know the balance between knowledgeable programmers
and developers, and users in the list membership.  I would like a healthy
discussion on these ideas and questions but I wouldn't want to add
inappropriate things to the list.

Thanks again - hope this is not taking too much of your time.

Bill Fenlason

ps. a snapshot would be great!

On first reading of your message, I thought that I needed to think
about what you were asking. Unfortunately, you got put way down in the
queue.

devil's advocate question: why not just keep track of your state and
compare: e.g. if (eof && !closed_delim_state)...

I'm always interested in suggestions, patches etc. please note: i'm
not saying no to your idea above, i'm just asking you to explain it to
me better--because i'm not quite getting what you're saying.

Certainly. If you'd like my current sources (which have migrated quite
a bit since Vern's last 2.5.4 release), let me know. you can have a
copy of the cvs repository or a snapshot of the current tree.

and what is your need for a modified skeleton? (i.e. is that something
which might be of use to the general flex user?)

Hello Will,

I assume that you have not had time to get to my last note, or perhaps it is
just too far down in the queue.  This one will keep it company  8-).

There are two lines of code that I've added to the skeleton which seem to
solve the problem of repeated calls at end of file and the yymore()
situation.  I'll briefly describe them so you can decide if you would like
to consider including them.

This is below the yywrap() test, near:
   case EOB_ACT_END_OF_FILE:

     yy_c_buf_p = yytext_ptr + YY_MORE_ADJ;

     yyleng = YY_MORE_ADJ;    /* <== Added Line */

As the related comment described, yytext was carefully set up.  This line
sets up yyleng as for a normal token.  The value will be the length of any
yymore() token (normally zero), which is the difference between the
current buffer pointer and the current text pointer.  The code after the
match
is made sets he length to one greater because of the double null EOB
marker.  --yyleng will work as well.

The second change is in the yy_get_next_buffer routine:

    ret_val = EOB_ACT_END_OF_FILE;

    /* <== Inserted if condition ==> */
    if ( yyin != yy_current_buffer->yy_input_file
    || yy_current_buffer-> yy_buffer_status == YY_BUFFER_NEW)

   yyrestart( yyin );

It makes the restart conditional on a change of the yyin address or a newly
created buffer.  It is not exactly the way I would like it, but it is not
unreasonable.

I can understand the desire to allow the user to just reassign yyin within
an <<EOF>> rule, but I think the earlier version approach of requiring the
user to issue YY_NEW_FILE is more orderly.  The philosophical issue is
if EOF is a persistent state or if a recall after it should automatically
imply that a new file is being provided.  Both sides of the argument can
have
advantages for the user and I had hoped for some discussion of the point
in case there is something that I don't understand about it.

I'm still testing and researching the code and will let you know if I find
anything else necessary - I need to more fully check the input() routine.  I
spent a while checking both the skeleton logic and the various alternatives
generated within gen.c.  Hopefully I didn't miss anything.  .

Yes, this came up a while ago, and I put together a flex release with
a modified copyright that begins:

        Redistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or
        without modification, are permitted provided that:

However, that version didn't get fully integrated into the sources I sent
to Will.  It's in the COPYING file but not in the individual source files,
just because I hadn't gotten around to it.

Will, feel free to update the copyrights in each of the files with the
one in COPYING.

By this, do you mean the "column"?  If your tokens do not span lines,
then you can use yyleng. If the tokens do span lines,
then you have to rescan the token. Yuk!

%%
  /* This is untested code. But in the right spirit ! */
  static int yycol=0, next_col=0;
  char* _p;

  /* Update yycol for tokens that do not contain '\n' */
  #define COL()  yycol=next_col; next_col += yyleng

  /* Update yycol for tokens that may possibly contain '\n' */
  #define COLN() do{ \
                   yycol=next_col; \
                   for(_p=yytext; *_p; _p++,next_col++)  \
                      if( *_p == '\n' )  \
                         next_col = -1; \
                 }while(0)

  #define NEWL() yycol = next_col= 0

foo|bar  { COL();  printf("%d: %s\n" ,  yycol, yytext); }
\n       { NEWL(); printf("%d: NEWL\n", yycol); }
foo\nbar { COLN(); printf("%d: %s\n" ,  yycol, yytext); }

%%

Hello!

I compiled lex-produced files with 'gcc -Wconversion', and it gives
warnings about passing arguments to fread/fwrite as unsigned due to
function prototypes. This produces warnings when program is compiled
under suggested 'strict warnings' in FreeBSD, ${BDECFLAGS}. More, these
warnings point to .l file that was fed to lex.

You can see detailed problem report, samples of failing code and a
proposed fix at:

http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/query-pr.cgi?pr=28364

Regards, Alexey.
PS. Waiting for fix and for FreeBSD to import fixed :)

Flex does allow comments everywhere you could possibly need them. This
discussion suggests a failure in the flex docs to make the syntax clear. What's
the trick, then? 

1. Use traditional C comments, not '//' comments.
2. INDENT THE COMMENT.
