 =>This would be a nice feature to have.  No one is working on it as far
 =>as I know.  John Bossom (jebossom@Cognos.COM) is working on reentrant
 =>scanners, though, which have the entire scanning state encapsulated in
 =>a single struct.
 =>...
 =>The trick of
 =>course is in getting the state reset correctly.  This is already done for
 =>EOB_ACT_CONTINUE_SCAN (which then also advances the state machine using
 =>yy_get_previous_state()), so you should be able to follow what it does.

Well, I got it working.  I added a flag and some state in the
yy_buffer_state structure to hold yy_bp and start_state, and some code
in gen.c and flex.skl to test the flag and do [what I hope is] the
right thing.  The patches are appended.  I wish I had time to do a
cleaner job of it (and thoroughly test it -- I dunno if it'll work
right when faced with strange buffer switching) but I'm in a bit of a
hurry...  I did try it with both C and C++, though.  If you're
interested, I'll clean up my test progs and send them as well.

To use it, just define YY_WEDGE to be the token you want returned if
the input stream blocks, and (optionally) YY_IS_WEDGED( ) to be a
function returning a boolean.  If you don't define YY_IS_WEDGED, the
default is to do "(errno==EWOULDBLOCK)".  Then, if YY_INPUT returns 0
and YY_IS_WEDGED( ) is true, yylex( ) will return YY_WEDGE.  If
YY_WEDGE is not defined, almost all my code gets #ifdef'd out and you
get a regular parser.

Regards,
d.
